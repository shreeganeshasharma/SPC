"The seven basic tools of quality is a designation given to a fixed set of graphical techniques 
identified as being most helpful in troubleshooting issues related to quality. They are called 
basic because they are suitable for people with little formal training in statistics and because
they can be used to solve the vast majority of quality-related issues" - Wikipedia

Quality can be defined as "fitness for use".

If a product or service is available in the market we look 
for some characteristic properties, and desire numerous dimensions 
which make it superior over other products, and improve its sales.


Therefore, it is paramount that we understand quality, achieve it, and control it.
